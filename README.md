# Image Gallery

A super simple image gallery for your webcomic, photos, and more. Inspired + dummy data by XKCD. Written in PHP.

## Features

* No databases
* PHP-based
* Includes RSS feed

## Get Started

Copy all ".php" and ".css" files to your server. Create `alt`, `image`, and `title` directories. Edit the `config.php` file with your details. Set the `license` field to the license of your images.

When you have a new image, name it `0.png`, `1.png`, `2.png`, etc and place them in the `image` folder. Create files `0.txt`, `1.txt`, `2.txt`, etc and place them in the `title` folder. These will be the titles of the images you place in the `image` folder under the same filename. Optionally, you can also create `.txt` files in the `alt` directory to add captions.
